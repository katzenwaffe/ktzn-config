# ktzn-config

Why, hello there! This repo is to hold my configuration files for Team Fortress 2. 


### üò∫ About This Config

I've played TF2 since 2008 and recently got back into the game after a decade and was desperate for my old binds.

This is a tailored config based for me as most user's who create one would. However, feel free to poke around or download the config if you'd like. *Please note, changes can be made frequently without notice.*



### üê±‚Äçüëì What's special about your config?

Absolutely nothing.

That's right, I said it. Config files should be preference to you but it's alright to see how someone else plays the game and try snippets of their config.



### üê±‚Äçüíª How to Install

*Please back up any and all custom configs you may have installed. I'm not responsible for any lost settings.*



  #### Installing with mastercomfig
  I use mastercomfig's High Settings
  (*mastercomfig's settings can be found here: https://mastercomfig.com/*)

  1. Place all contents within this package to:

  ```
  Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg\user
  ```

  Whilst implementing mastercomfig's settings, I found that I could not execute inside the `tf\custom` folder. Now, I'm not sure why I'm able to run from the `tf\cfg` folder but I'm not complaining. In the future I may pry into why this is occurring, but for now, I'll leave it as is.



  #### Installing without mastercomfig

  1. Maybe you're just testing waters, that's fine! To install as you would with any config file place all contents in:

  ```
  Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\~config folder~
  ```

  2. Now, `~config folder~` is a folder that you can name anything. This is just to keep everything tidy for you and if you want to delete the config from your system, delete the folder.
